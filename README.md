# PhotonPairLab
## Description
**PhotonPairLab** is a Python-based simulation toolkit for modeling the generation of photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear crystals. This project is designed with a clean, modular, and object-oriented architecture, making it extensible for further development or integration into larger quantum optics simulations.

## Features

* Object-oriented architecture with clean separation of concerns.
* Models type-0, type-I and type-II SPDC processes.
* Visualization tools for key physical quantities, including joint spectral properties, enabling intuitive analysis and interpretation of SPDC processes.
* Easily extendable to support different crystal types and pump configurations.

## Architecture Overview

The codebase is structured using well-defined classes:

* `materials`: Provides models for nonlinear optical materials, including their Sellmeier coefficients, temperature corrections, and thermal expansion properties.
* `crystal`: Encapsulates physical properties like poling period, temperature, and dispersion. 
* `laser`: Models the pump laser, including its wavelength and bandwidth.
* `spdc`: Handles the simulation, analysis, and visualization of SPDC processes, including computing the JSA and related quantities.

This separation makes the code easy to read, maintain, and expand.

## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress, and while I strive for accuracy, there may still be areas that need improvement or refinement. I encourage experts in the field to contribute by:

* Adding new materials, including their Sellmeier coefficients, temperature corrections, and thermal expansion properties.
* Reviewing the current implementation to ensure correctness from a physics perspective.
* Suggesting improvements to existing features or providing feedback on better approaches.
* Proposing or implementing new capabilities that could enhance the project's functionality.

Your expertise and contributions would be greatly appreciated to make this project more robust and reliable!
