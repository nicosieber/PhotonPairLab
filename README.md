# PhotonPairLab
## Description
Object oriented implementation of the simulation of joint spectral amplitudes and other properties related to SPDC.

## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress, and while I strive for accuracy, there may still be areas that need improvement or refinement. I encourage experts in the field to contribute by:

* Adding new materials, including their Sellmeier coefficients, temperature corrections, and thermal expansion properties.
* Reviewing the current implementation to ensure correctness from a physics perspective.
* Suggesting improvements to existing features or providing feedback on better approaches.
* Proposing or implementing new capabilities that could enhance the project's functionality.

Your expertise and contributions would be greatly appreciated to make this project more robust and reliable!
